# CodeDevils' Docs

Welcome to [docs.codedevils.org](/)! This is the official CodeDevils' documentation website. You can find basic information about the club and the process of contributing to our projects.

## understanding the docs?

When creating this website, CodeDevils devs decided to use [Nextra](https://nextra.site) as the documentation framework. Nextra is a Next.js and MDX powered documentation generation tool for creating documentation websites with ease and will make it easier for us to maintain and update the documentation later down the line.
